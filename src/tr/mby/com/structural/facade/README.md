# Facade Design Pattern
## Definition
Facade is a structural design pattern that provides a simplified interface to a library, a framework, or any other 
complex set of classes. A facade might provide limited functionality in comparison to working with the subsystem 
directly. However, it includes only those features that clients really care about.


## Applicability
- Use the Facade pattern when you need to have a limited but straightforward interface to a complex subsystem.
- Use the Facade when you want to structure a subsystem into layers.
