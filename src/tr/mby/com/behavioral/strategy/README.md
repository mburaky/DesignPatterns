# Strategy Design Pattern
## Definition
Strategy is a behavioral design pattern that lets you define a family of algorithms, put each of them into a separate 
class, and make their objects interchangeable.


## Applicability
- Use the Strategy pattern when you want to use different variants of an algorithm within an object and be able to 
switch from one algorithm to another during runtime.
- Use the Strategy when you have a lot of similar classes that only differ in the way they execute some behavior.
- Use the pattern to isolate the business logic of a class from the implementation details of algorithms that may not 
be as important in the context of that logic.
- Use the pattern when your class has a massive conditional operator that switches between different variants of the 
same algorithm.
