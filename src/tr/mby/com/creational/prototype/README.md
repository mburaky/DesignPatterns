# Factory Design Pattern
## Definition
Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects without making your code dependent on 
their classes.

An object that supports cloning is called a prototype.


## Applicability
- Use the Prototype pattern when your code shouldnâ€™t depend on the concrete classes of objects that you need to copy.

- Use the pattern when you want to reduce the number of subclasses that only differ in the way they initialize their 
respective objects. Somebody could have created these subclasses to be able to create objects with a specific 
configuration.
