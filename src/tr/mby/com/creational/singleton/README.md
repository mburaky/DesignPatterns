# Singleton Design Pattern
## Definition
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a 
global access point to this instance.

- Ensure that a class has just a single instance. 
- Provide a global access point to that instance. 
    - Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that instance 
from being overwritten by other code.
