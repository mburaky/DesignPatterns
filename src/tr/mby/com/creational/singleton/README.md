# Singleton Design Pattern
## Definition
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a 
global access point to this instance.

- Ensure that a class has just a single instance. 
- Provide a global access point to that instance. 
    - Singleton pattern lets you access some object from anywhere in the program. However, it also protects that instance 
from being overwritten by other code.

## Applicability
- Use the Singleton pattern when a class in your program should have just a single instance available to all clients; 
for example, a single database object shared by different parts of the program.
-  Use the Singleton pattern when you need stricter control over global variables.
