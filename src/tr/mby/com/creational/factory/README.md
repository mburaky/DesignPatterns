# Factory Design Pattern
## Definition
Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass, but 
allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.


## Applicability
- Use the Factory Method when you donâ€™t know beforehand the exact types and dependencies of the objects your code 
should work with.

- Use the Factory Method when you want to provide users of your library or framework with a way to extend its internal 
components.

- Use the Factory Method when you want to save system resources by reusing existing objects instead of rebuilding them 
each time.
